# Cambridge-SHeM-Pinhole-Plate-Design-and-Analysis

A Python analysis script that parameterizes the pinhole plate geometry.

where $a$ is the full length of the axis of the detector aperture, $b$ is the separation between the center of the pinhole aperture and the detector aperture, $H_p$ is the height of the pinhole aperture above the plate, $H_d$ is the height of the detector aperture above the plate, $\alpha$ is the incidence angle of the helium beam, and $\beta$ is the tilt angle of the detector aperture.
